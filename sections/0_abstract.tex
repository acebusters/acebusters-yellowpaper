We present an efficient protocol to rotate in and out of an active state channel including secure cash distribution. Of this, a busy cash-game poker table with players sitting down and standing up is a prime example.
 
Our protocol has an initial phase where a participant interact with the cryptocurrency network to join a state channel. After that, new and previous participants needs to communicate only with each other over the course of many interactions. At any time a participant can signal intention to leave the state channel and rotate out from the channel without interrupting the ongoing message exchange.
 
We describe the stateful contract model and the security notions that our protocol accomplishes. Moreover, we provide a reference implementation in Solidity for the stateful contract that our protocol is based on.

In comparison to existing payment channels, our multi-party state channels (MSC) implementation is more efficient and has additional features.
