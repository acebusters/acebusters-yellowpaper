We present an efficient protocol to rotate in and out of an active payment channel including secure cash distribution. Of this, a busy poker table with players joining and leaving is a prime example.
 
Our protocol has an initial phase where a party interact with a cryptocurrency network, that then enables it to interact only with the other participants of the channel over the course of playing many poker hands. At any time a participant can securely rotate out of the payment channel without interrupting its execution.
 
We describe the stateful contract model and the security notions that our protocol accomplishes. Moreover, we provide a reference implementation in Solidity for the stateful contract that our protocol is based on. In comparison to existing payment channels, our multi-party state channels implementation is more efficient and has additional features.
