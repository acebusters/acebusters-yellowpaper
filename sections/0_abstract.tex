We present a payment channel concept for up to 10 participants and an efficient protocol to rotate in and out of this multiparty state channel including secure cash distribution. Of this, a busy cash-game poker table with players sitting down and standing up is a prime example.
 
Our protocol has an initial phase where a participant interacts with the blockchain to join a state channel. After that, new and previous participants need to communicate only with each other over the course of many message exchanges. At any time a participant can signal intention to leave the state channel and eventually rotate out from the channel without interrupting the ongoing message flow or affecting the security of funds.
 
We describe the stateful contract model and the security notions that our protocol accomplishes. Moreover, we provide a reference implementation as smart contract in Solidity.

In comparison to existing payment channels, our multiparty state channels are more efficient and have additional features.
