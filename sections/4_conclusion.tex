\section{Conclusion}

In this paper multiparty state channels have been introduced, discussed and formally defined. Implementing the introduced multiparty state channels, the reader may create a highly effective protocol for real-time poker while keeping the interaction with the cryptocurrency network to a minimum.

The introduced multiparty state channel can also be valuable for protocols that require secure computation, enabling fair games. Yet, the verification of secure computation proofs is not yet affordable. With the upcoming Metropolis upgrade Ethereum might make secure computation affordable.
