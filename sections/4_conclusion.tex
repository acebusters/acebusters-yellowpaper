\section{Conclusion}

The combination of standard secure computation and stateful contracts enables fair protocols that are highly
efficient, since the interaction with the cryptocurrency network is kept to a minimum. The same is also true
for secure cash distribution protocols, and in particular the efficient poker protocol that we provide. Stateful
contracts can also be valuable for protocols that do not require secure computation, as demonstrated by our
design of a duplex payment channel.
